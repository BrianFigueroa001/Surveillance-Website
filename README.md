# Livestream Website
A home surveillance system for a school project and to find out who is stealing my mail.

Users can log in to view a live stream from my webcam originally (currently changed to a live-stream of a random place in Alabama so I can show off this project without havingrandom strangers view my webcam feed).

I used yawcam to make my webcam accessible through a public IP made available on the internet using https://www.noip.com/.

Currently hosted on heroku in a separate repository.

# Current Updates
NOTE: due to not wanting random strangers to see my webcam feed, I changed the livestream feed to show a street in Montevallo, Alambama.
Source of stream: https://www.insecam.org/en/view/870988/

This change is applied only in the other heroku git repository. This repository retains the same URL for my webcam feed which involved running yawcam (you still can't see my webcam feed with that url).
